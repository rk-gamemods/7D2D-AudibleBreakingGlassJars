BRIEF OVERVIEW (350 character limit)

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

In 7 Days to Die, when you drink from a glass jar (water, tea, etc.), there's a configurable "Jar Return Percentage" that determines whether you get the empty jar back or it breaks. The problem? [b]There's no audio feedback[/b] when a jar breaks - you only notice later when checking your inventory.

This mod adds a satisfying glass breaking sound effect when your jar doesn't survive the drink. Now you'll know immediately whether you got your jar back or lost it.
