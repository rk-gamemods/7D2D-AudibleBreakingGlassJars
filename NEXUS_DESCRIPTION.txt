BRIEF OVERVIEW (350 character limit)
================================================================================

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (BBCode)
================================================================================

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

When you drink from a glass jar (water, tea, etc.), there's a configurable "Jar Return Percentage" that determines whether you get the empty jar back or it breaks. The problem? [b]There's no audio feedback[/b] when a jar breaks - you only notice later when checking your inventory.

This mod plays a glass shatter sound when your jar doesn't survive. Now you'll know immediately when you've lost one.

[size=4][b]Multiplayer[/b][/size]

[b]Not tested.[/b] Based on how the mod works:

[list]
[*][b]Client-side only[/b] - Each player hears their own sounds locally

[*][b]Custom sounds[/b] - May work; built-in game sounds should be fine
[/list]

If you test this in multiplayer, please share your results!
