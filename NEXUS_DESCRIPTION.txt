BRIEF OVERVIEW (350 character limit)

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

In 7 Days to Die, when you drink from a glass jar (water, tea, etc.), there's a configurable "Jar Return Percentage" that determines whether you get the empty jar back or it breaks. The problem? [b]There's no audio feedback[/b] when a jar breaks - you only notice later when checking your inventory.

This mod adds a satisfying glass breaking sound effect when your jar doesn't survive the drink. Now you'll know immediately whether you got your jar back or lost it.

[size=4][b]How It Works[/b][/size]

The mod detects when you drink a jarred beverage and checks whether an empty jar was returned to your inventory. If not, it plays the glass breaking sound. Simple and unobtrusive.

[b]Sound plays when:[/b]
[list]
[*]Jar Return = 0% - Sound plays every time (all jars break)
[*]Jar Return = 50% - Sound plays about half the time
[*]Jar Return = 100% - Sound never plays (all jars return)
[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size]

[list]
[*]7 Days to Die V2.5 (tested)
[*]EAC must be disabled (required for all DLL mods)
[*]No other dependencies
[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size]

[list=1]
[*]Download the file and extract the zip
[*]Copy the [b]AudibleBreakingGlassJars[/b] folder to your [b]7 Days To Die/Mods/[/b] folder
[*]You should have: [b]Mods/AudibleBreakingGlassJars/AudibleBreakingGlassJars.dll[/b]
[*]Launch the game with EAC disabled
[/list]

To disable EAC: Right-click the game in Steam > Properties > General. In the [b]Select Launch Option[/b] dropdown, choose [b]Launch Game without EAC[/b].

To uninstall: Delete the [b]Mods/AudibleBreakingGlassJars/[/b] folder.

[line]

[size=4][b]Configuration[/b][/size]

Edit [b]Config/config.xml[/b] in the mod folder:

[code]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
    <SoundName>glass-shatter</SoundName>
    <DebugMode>false</DebugMode>
</config>
[/code]

[b]Sound Options:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]glass-shatter[/b] (default) - Included custom sound that sounds like a jar breaking
[*][b]glassdestroy[/b] - Game's built-in glass sound - louder, like a window breaking
[*][b]Your own sound[/b] - Drop any .ogg or .wav file in the Sounds/ folder and set the name in config
[/list]

The custom sound is the default because the game's glass sound is designed for breaking glass blocks, not jars.

[b]Using Your Own Sound:[/b]
[list=1]
[*]Place your .ogg or .wav file in the [b]Sounds/[/b] folder
[*]Set [b]SoundName[/b] in config.xml to the filename (without extension)
[/list]
That's it! The mod auto-detects files in the Sounds folder.

[b]Debug Mode:[/b]
Set [b]DebugMode[/b] to [b]true[/b] to see detailed logging in the game console. Look for messages starting with [b][ABGJ-Debug][/b]. Useful for troubleshooting.

[size=4][b]Mod Compatibility[/b][/size]

This mod is [b]highly compatible[/b] with other mods because:
[list]
[*]It only [b]reads[/b] inventory counts - never modifies items
[*]Uses Harmony patches that observe, not replace
[*]Works alongside inventory mods, backpack expansions, etc.
[/list]

[b]Tested compatible with:[/b]
[list]
[*]ProxiCraft (Craft from Containers)
[*]AGF Backpack mods
[*]Most UI overhauls
[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Multiplayer[/b][/size]

[b]Not tested.[/b] Here's what we expect:

[list]
[*][b]Client-side only[/b] - Each player should hear their own jar break sounds locally
[*][b]No server install needed[/b] - The mod only reads your local inventory and plays sounds
[*][b]Custom sounds[/b] - Unknown if runtime-loaded audio works in multiplayer; game sounds should work
[/list]

If you test this in multiplayer, please let us know how it works!
