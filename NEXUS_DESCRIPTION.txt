DETAILED DESCRIPTION (BBCode)
================================================================================

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

When you drink from a glass jar (water, tea, etc.), there's a configurable "Jar Return Percentage" that determines whether you get the empty jar back or it breaks. The problem? [b]There's no audio feedback[/b] when a jar breaks - you only notice later when checking your inventory.

This mod plays a glass shatter sound when your jar doesn't survive. Now you'll know immediately when you've lost one.

[line]

[size=4][b]How It Works[/b][/size]

The mod detects when you drink from a jar and checks whether an empty jar was returned to your inventory. If not, it plays the sound.

[b]When the sound plays:[/b]
[list]
[*]Jar Return = 0% - Every time (all jars break)
[*]Jar Return = 50% - About half the time
[*]Jar Return = 100% - Never (all jars return)
[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size]

[*]No other dependencies
[/list]

[line]

[list=1]
[*]Download and extract the mod
[*]Copy the [b]AudibleBreakingGlassJars[/b] folder to your [b]7 Days To Die/Mods/[/b] folder
[*]You should have: [b]Mods/AudibleBreakingGlassJars/AudibleBreakingGlassJars.dll[/b]

[size=4][b]Configuration[/b][/size]

Edit [b]Config/config.xml[/b] in the mod folder:

[code]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
    <SoundName>glass-shatter</SoundName>
    <DebugMode>false</DebugMode>
</config>
[/code]

[b]Sound Options:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]glass-shatter[/b] (default) - Custom jar-breaking sound. Default because the game's sounds are designed for glass blocks, not jars.
[*][b]glassdestroy[/b] - Game's built-in sound - louder, like a window breaking
[*][b]Your own sound[/b] - Add any .ogg or .wav to Sounds/ folder, set the filename in config
[/list]

[b]Using Your Own Sound:[/b]
[list=1]
[*]Place your .ogg or .wav file in the [b]Sounds/[/b] folder
[*]Set [b]SoundName[/b] in config.xml to the filename (without extension)
[/list]

[b]Debug Mode:[/b]
Set [b]DebugMode[/b] to [b]true[/b] for detailed logging. Look for [b][ABGJ-Debug][/b] messages in the game console.

[line]

[size=4][b]Mod Compatibility[/b][/size]

This mod should work well with other mods because:
[list]
[*]Read-only - checks inventory counts, never modifies items
[*]Uses non-destructive Harmony patches
[*]Works alongside inventory mods, backpack expansions, etc.
[/list]

[b]Tested with:[/b]
[list]
[*]ProxiCraft
[*]AGF Backpack mods
[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Multiplayer[/b][/size]

[b]Not tested.[/b] Based on how the mod works:

[list]
[*][b]Client-side only[/b] - Each player hears their own sounds locally
[*][b]No server install needed[/b] - Only reads local inventory and plays audio
[*][b]Custom sounds[/b] - May work; built-in game sounds should be fine
[/list]

If you test this in multiplayer, please share your results!

[size=5][b]ADDON MODS (Optional Downloads)[/b][/size]

These addons work independently - you can use any combination:

[line]

[size=4][b]Addon: Broken Glass From Broken Jars[/b][/size]
[i]v0.1.0 Beta[/i]

When a glass jar breaks from drinking, you now receive 1x [b]Broken Glass[/b] (resourceBrokenGlass). Makes jar breakage less punishing and more realistic - the glass doesn't just vanish!

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
[*]Gives 1 broken glass when jars break from drinking
[*]Tries backpack first, then toolbelt, then drops on ground
[*]Uses same detection as main mod (respects jar return %)
[*]Fully independent - works without main mod installed
[/list]

[b]Installation:[/b] Copy [b]AudibleBreakingGlassJars_Addon_BrokenGlass[/b] folder to Mods/

[line]

[size=4][b]Addon: Jar Return On Craft[/b][/size]
[i]v0.1.0 Beta[/i]

Fixes the "jar duplication exploit" in vanilla crafting. When you craft with jar contents (water, tea, etc.), the empty jar is returned [b]immediately[/b] when crafting starts - and [b]NOT refunded[/b] if you cancel.

[b]The Problem:[/b]
Vanilla 7D2D lets you start crafting tea, immediately cancel, and get your water back - but keep the jar that was "used" to make the water. This addon closes that loophole.

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
[*]Returns empty jar when craft job starts (not when complete)
[*]Canceling does NOT refund jar contents (water, tea, etc.)
[*]Smart detection: only affects jar-content recipes
[*]Exception: jar-to-jar recipes (water→tea) use vanilla behavior
[*]Dynamic detection works with modded jar items
[*]Optional XML config for manual item overrides
[/list]

[b]Installation:[/b] Copy [b]AudibleBreakingGlassJars_Addon_JarReturn[/b] folder to Mods/

[size=3][color=#ff6600][b]⚠️ Highly Recommended: VanillaJarFix[/b][/color][/size]

For a complete jar economy fix, we recommend also using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/9353]VanillaJarFix[/url]. It removes jar refunds from recipes entirely (at the XML level), so you always get jars back. Our addon is fully compatible with VanillaJarFix - if VanillaJarFix removes the jar refund property, our mod automatically respects that.

[line]

[size=4][b]Addon Compatibility[/b][/size]

[list]
[*][b]Main mod + BrokenGlass:[/b] Sound plays AND you get broken glass
[*][b]Main mod + JarReturn:[/b] Sound plays when drinking; jars returned on craft
[*][b]All three together:[/b] Full jar experience!
[*][b]Addons without main mod:[/b] Work fine independently
[*][b]VanillaJarFix:[/b] Fully compatible - dynamic detection respects its changes
