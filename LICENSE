Audible Breaking Glass Jars is a mod for 7 Days to Die that adds audio feedback
when drinking from glass jars results in the jar breaking instead of being
returned to inventory.

NOVEL CONCEPT:
This mod addresses an overlooked gap in the game's audio feedback system. While
the game has a configurable "Jar Return Percentage" setting, there was previously
no way to know whether a jar broke or was returned without checking your inventory.
This mod provides that missing feedback through an audible glass breaking sound.
