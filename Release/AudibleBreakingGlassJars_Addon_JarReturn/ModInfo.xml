    <DisplayName value="Jar Return On Craft" />
    <Description value="Addon for AudibleBreakingGlassJars. When crafting with jar contents (bottled water, beer, honey, etc.), the empty jar is returned immediately - simulating pouring the contents into the pot. If the job is cancelled, jar content ingredients are NOT refunded since you already received the empty jar. Recipes that output jar-based drinks (water→tea) use vanilla behavior. RECOMMENDED: Use with VanillaJarFix mod to correct vanilla bugs where solid foods incorrectly have jar properties." />
