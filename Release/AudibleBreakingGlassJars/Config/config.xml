    Sound to play when a glass jar breaks during consumption.

    Custom sounds (place .ogg or .wav file in Sounds/ folder):
      glass-shatter  - Custom glass breaking sound (default, included) - sounds like a jar

    Game sounds (no file needed, uses built-in game audio):
      glassdestroy   - Game's glass destruction sound - louder, like a window breaking

    The custom sound is the default because the game's glass sound is designed for
    breaking glass blocks, not jars. The game sound option is available for those
    who prefer it, for potential multiplayer compatibility, or in case a better
    game sound is added in a future release.

    The mod will automatically detect if a matching file exists in Sounds/
    and load it at runtime. If not found, it uses the game's sound system.
