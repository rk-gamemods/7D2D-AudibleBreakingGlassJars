    Sound to play when a glass jar breaks during consumption.

    Custom sounds (place .ogg or .wav file in Sounds/ folder):
      glass-shatter  - Custom glass breaking sound (default, included)

    Game sounds (no file needed, uses built-in game audio):
      glassdestroy   - Glass block destruction sound (loud, dramatic)
      itembreak      - Generic item breaking sound

    The mod will automatically detect if a matching file exists in Sounds/
    and load it at runtime. If not found, it uses the game's sound system.
